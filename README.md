# Melody-Diffuser

Melody-Diffuser is a discrete diffusion transformer for generating monophonic symbolic music. It is trained on a dataset of over 10,000,000 4 measure exerpts, quantized to the 16th note.

It also has a novel conditioning mechanism using hand gesture tracking. 

I have attatched links to unconditioned samples.
